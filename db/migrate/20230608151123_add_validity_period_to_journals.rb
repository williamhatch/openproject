    #   small amount needs to be subtracted as later on the validity_period is calculated as a range from the predecessor's
    #   created_at to the successor's created_at. If the two values would be equal, the range would be empty
    #   resulting in an error.
    # * updated_at is only altered if created_at and updated_at are equal, meaning the journal has never been updated.

    #   by the user at anytime.
    #   This might have the consequence of the updated_at wrongfully being after the created_at of the successor,
    #   but this will not be invalid.
