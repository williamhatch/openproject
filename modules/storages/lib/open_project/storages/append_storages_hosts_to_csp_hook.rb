class ::OpenProject::Storages::AppendStoragesHostsToCspHook < OpenProject::Hook::Listener
  # OpenProject's front-end needs to allow the browser to connect to external
  # file servers for direct file uploads. Therefore it needs to extend its
  # Content Security Policy (CSP) `connect-src` with the hostnames of all
  # servers that the current user is allowed to upload files to. That is all
  # storages activated in at least one active project for which the user has the
  # `manage_file_links` permission.
  #
  # The allowed values can be different for each user and can change on store
  # activations, store removals, role changes, and even project membership
  # changes. Caching it without accessing the database seems almost impossible,
  # so we decided to not do it for now.
  #
  # The CSP is extended for all HTML requests as work packages can pop in many
  # places of OpenProject, and we want to be able to upload in all those places
  # (work packages module, BCF module, notification center, boards, ...).
